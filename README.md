# MyST Templates

A community curated collection of [MyST Markdown](https://mystmd.org) compatible templates.
These templates allow `myst` to export markdown files as typeset, formatted documents using PDF, LaTeX or Word.
Templates can expose data-driven options for customization ensuring the final documents comply with author submission guidelines provided by a particular journal, conference organizer or university.

This repository:

- holds issues for new and general information for improving existing templates
- downloads each template listed in the [data](./data) folder
- deploys an API to https://api.mystmd.org
- automatically updates the organization readme

## Contributing a LaTeX Template

To add a new LaTeX template, [fork this repo](https://github.com/myst-templates/templates/fork), and modify [tex.yml](./data/tex.yml), the new template should be added as a new entry in the listing:

```yaml
templates:
  - organization: myst
    name: agu2019
    source: https://github.com/myst-templates/agu2019
    latest: main
```

Once you've made your change, open a PR.

## Contributing a Docx Template

Docx templating currently requires a dynamic rendering function using [docx](https://docx.js.org/#/) passed directly to `mystjs`.
However, data-driven options specified by a `template.yml` are still passed to this renderer. These may be added at [docx.yml](./data/docx.yml), similar to LaTeX template.

[Fork this repo](https://github.com/myst-templates/templates/fork), make your change and open a PR.

## Development

Install the mini CLI tool using `npm install` and `npm run dev` (puts this in watch mode, so you can kill after the output is complete).
Then call `myst-templates-api index data/tex.yml` from the main folder, which will create an index file and update the organization Readme.
